# Mouse Control App

A Node.js and Vue.js application that allows you to control your PC's mouse using a mobile device over a local network. Uses `socket.io` for real-time communication and `@nut-tree-fork/nut-js` for mouse control.

- Move the mouse cursor using touch gestures on a mobile device.
- Perform left-clicks remotely.
- Both the PC (server) and mobile device (client) must be on the same network.
